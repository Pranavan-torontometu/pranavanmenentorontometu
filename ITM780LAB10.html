        <!-- SEO Techniques -->
        <p>
            An SEO technique I think is effective is, using keywords strategically within your content/text. By inserting relevant and well-researched keywords into your webpage titles, headers, and body texts, search engines understand your content better and are able to rank it higher because the search engine believes it is more relevant to what is being searched. This increases your website's visibility compared to websites that don't have keywords, resulting in more traffic being driven to your website.    </p>
        <p>
            Another important SEO practice is creating high-quality backlinks, which are links from other reputable websites that point to your site. . Backlinks are like upvotes of your content, telling the search engine that your website is credible, trustworthy, and authentic. When it comes to backlinks, the more quality backlinks you have from trusted sources, the higher your website's domain authority becomes, boosting its ranking in search engine results. However, some backlinks give higher approval than others, for example government organizations or industry leading research organizations carry more weight  than unknown, low quality sources. When it comes to backlinks, while quantity is helpful, quality is better and more preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third SEO technique is optimizing your website for mobile devices. As the majority of web traffic now comes from mobile users, having a site that functions seamlessly on smartphones and tablets is  necessary for a website. This can be done by creating a responsive web design that changes the layout of the website based on the screen size of the user's device. Also, optimizing for mobile involves reducing page loading times, since research shows that users are more likely to leave a site that takes more than a few seconds to load. Mobile optimizaiton also means that navigation should be clear, clickable, intuitive, and easy to use on small screens. Search engines also prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their rankings, meaning sites that don't meet certain mobile standards risk on a lower ranking and therefore losing traffic.
        </p>

        <!-- SMO Techniques -->
        <p>
            Adding social media share buttons, such as a Facebook or Instagram like button, is an effective SMO technique that can significantly expand the reach of your content. When there is a share option on your website, users can share the content easily and it is more likely to be shared across various social media platforms. This can help with credibility, because people tend to view/trust things that are liked by many people than posts that have few likes. This can help build trust and credibility for your website. Additionally, a share buttons is basically free advertising because it gives you more visibility, and this can help generate more traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Utilizing Instagram integration is another effective SMO technique for businesses looking to engage with their customers, this can also help with advertisement, promotions, events etc. This can be done through Instagram’s visual focused nature, which allows companies to creatively showcase their products, services, or events through photos, videos, and stories. Embedding an Instagram feed directly onto your website adds dynamic, engaging content which can also encourage people who visit your website to at least view your Instagram profile and potentially follow your account for regular updates. Instagram’s large and diverse user base allows businesses to reach new audiences and connect with potential customers. Additionally, user-generated content, such as customers tagging your brand in their posts, can serve as social proof, which builds trust and can help drive more traffic back to your site.</p>
        <p>
            A third SMO strategy is engaging in active social media participation, which involves consistent and meaningful interaction with your audience/customer base across various platforms. This can come in the form of regularly posting new content showcasing your products, responding to comments or answering questions, and also sharing any user-generated content through reposts. When you consistently engage with your followers, it can help build a good relationship which can show that you don't just care about their money, but also care about them. Another positive to engaging with your followers is that, on social media platforms, accounts that have higher engagement make it so your posts are more likely to be seen by people who aren't following you. This can help drive website traffic as users would click to learn more about your business/product.
